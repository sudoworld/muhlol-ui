### Muhlol Ui

MuhLol Ui is a World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade add-on that comes in the style of the well-known Lorti Ui and has many other options.

I'm currently still working on the interface and it will be completed shortly.

In addition to the black coloring of the standard WoW UI, it also includes many useful, well-known addons, all of which are colored so that everything has a consistent style, which is very important to me personally.

Since there were already questions in the Discord. No, this UI will not be available for other versions because I am a pure TBC 2.4.3 player.

I can't say how long it will take to produce a version because I keep finding new errors and I just don't want to release a buggy version.
